# TODO

## Bugs to fix
debug menu -> fill item pocket -> game crashes
pick up any item -> game crashes 
- issue is probably related to the item pocket being bigger than 255 therefore u8 is too small and has to be adjusted everywhere to u16

can go through jump over steps in little root town probably related to the ends of the steps
- needs further testing
